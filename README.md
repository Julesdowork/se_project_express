## Description

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for my WTWR application. I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with databases, set up security and testing, and deploy web applications on a remote machine. My eventual goal is to create a server with an API and user authorization.

## Tech Stack

- NPM & Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- Postman (for testing)

## Devlog

Coming Soon...
